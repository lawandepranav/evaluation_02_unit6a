                Sport keeps us fit. Keeps you mindful. Brings us together.
                Through sport we have the power to change lives. Whether it is
                through stories of inspiring athletes. Helping you to get up and
                get moving. Sportswear featuring the latest technologies, to up
                your performance. Beat your PB. adidas offers a home to the
                runner, the basketball player, the soccer kid, the fitness
                enthusiast. The weekend hiker that loves to escape the city. The
                yoga teacher that spreads the moves. The 3-Stripes are seen in
                the music scene. On stage, at festivals. Our sports clothing
                keeps you focused before that whistle blows. During the race.
                And at the finish lines. We’re here to support creators. Improve
                their game. Their lives. And change the world.

                adidas designs for and with athletes of all kinds. Creators, who
                love to change the game. Challenge conventions. Break the rules
                and define new ones. Then break them again. We supply teams and
                individuals with athletic clothing pre-match. To stay focussed.
                We design sports apparel that get you to the finish line. To win
                the match. We support women, with bras and tights made for
                purpose. From low to high support. Maximum comfort. We design,
                innovate and itterate. Testing new technologies in action. On
                the pitch, the tracks, the court, the pool. Retro workout
                clothes inspire new streetwear essentials. Like NMD, Ozweego and
                our Firebird tracksuits. Classic sports models are brought back
                to life. Like Stan Smith. And Superstar. Now seen on the streets
                and the stages.
                <br />
                <br />
                Through our collections we blur the borders between high fashion
                and high performance. Like our adidas by Stella McCartney
                athletic clothing collection – designed to look the part inside
                and outside of the gym. Or some of our adidas Originals
                lifestyle pieces, that can be worn as sportswear too. Our lives
                are constantly changing. Becoming more and more versatile. And
                adidas designs with that in mind.
